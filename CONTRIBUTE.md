# How to help

Well, first of all, thanks for your interest :) It already means a lot!

If you would like to help, you can do so in many ways:

* **Fix errors or correct typos:** either open a PR or an issue
* **Point out a missing widget:** please open an issue
* **Suggest improvements for the webpage itself:** same than above
* **I want to code and help!** Please fork and open a PR once you are done! Excited to see what you will end up with :)

If you go for the latter, try to use the existing toolbox this project relies on: Pug and SCSS only. No JS for now. If you feel it is unavoidable, do not hesitate to open an issue and start a discussion.
